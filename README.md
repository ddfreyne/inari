# Inari

_Inari_ is a game written in Crystal, using [Glove](https://github.com/ddfreyne/glove) as the game engine. It (along with Glove) is very much work in progress and intended mostly as a playground.

## Prerequisites

1. Install Crystal (on OS X: `brew install crystal-lang`)
2. Install GLEW and GLFW (on OS X: `brew install homebrew/versions/glfw3 glew`)

## Building

Use `make` to build the game.
