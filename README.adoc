== Idea

* Focus on exploration
** Start on one tile
** Discover new tiles
** Random events
** No AI; static world
** Collect loot (possibly battle)
** Upgrade ship
* Actions
** Scout tile
** Attack tile
** Upgrade ship (requires shop/base/outpost/…)
** Retreat?
* Scoring
** Time/turn limit
** Goals
*** Conquer three beta-class star systems
*** Find three artifacts
* Self-balancing game
** A little like guid of dungeoneering
** When exploring, have the choice between three tiles (difficulties)
* RPG-like, but no XP points (too artificial)
* Selected randomness
** No randomness in available actions
** World discovery
** Available upgrades
** Enemies present

1. Click on visible tile. The ship travels, and finds no loot. Turn ends.
